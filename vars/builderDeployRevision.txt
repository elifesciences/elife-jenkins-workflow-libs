In order:

- makes sure `stackname` is up and running
- deploys the commit `revision` on `stackname`
- provisions `stackname` again after the code change to make sure all processes are up-to-date.

If there are multiple servers involved, `concurrency` is useful to decide how to deploy:
- `serial`: one at a time
- `parallel`: all together
- `blue-green`: 50% at a time

A commit status is also produced, named `continuous-integration/jenkins/deploy`.
