Runs a generic update pipeline, for example to update a library dependency.

In order:
- runs the `updateStep`, a closure that should cause some modification to the local workspace
- runs the `describeStep`, a closure that should return a string describing the modification
- commits, push and opens a pull request for this change.

`updateStep` should `git add` the modification it wants to include, but without committing them. In case `updateStep` does not produce changes, the pipeline stops.

`branchPrefix` can be used to customize the name to use; it will be concatenated to the build number for uniqueness.
`library` can be set to `true` if the project is a library, so that the build can be run on a library slave.
