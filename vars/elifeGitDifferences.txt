Returns `true` if there are difference ready to be committed in Git's index.

Do this after `git add` because:

- otherwise the diff used by this command will be empty
- you may miss out on new files otherwise

A `subfolder` argument can be passed to limit the check for differences to a subfolder of the repository (defaults to `.`)
