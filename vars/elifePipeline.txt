Should be used as the top level construct for pipeline stages. Accepts a block and wraps it with timestamps and colors to make the build output more understandable.

If a `maintainers.txt` file is present in the repository, build failures will be sent to them through email or Slack notifications:

- `foo@example.com`
- `#my-slack-channel`

An additional `timeoutInMinutes` can be passed to override the default 2 hours maximum running time.
