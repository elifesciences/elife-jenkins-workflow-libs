Runs the spectrum (usually end2end) tests.

Call with named parameters:
- `deploy`: map with keys `stackname`, `revision` and `folder`. Will deploy `revision` to `stackname` as the `preliminaryStep` and run smoke tests in `folder`. Will rollback `stackname` to `approved` (if needed), running smoke tests again. For `concurrency`: `serial`, `parallel`, `blue-green`, See `builderDeployRevision`.
- `Closure preliminaryStep`: execute after having reserved the environment but before running tests; for example, deploying new code. When `deploy` is specified, this is optional, otherwise overrides the default `preliminaryStep`.
- `Closure rollbackStep`: execute in case of failure, bringing back the environment to a working combination of versions. When `deploy` is specified, this is optional, otherwise overrides the default `rollbackStep`.
- `String environmentName`: `end2end` or `continuumtest`. Defaults to `end2end`.
- `processes`: number of parallel processes to use. Defaults to 10.
- `marker`: filter for the group of tests to run, often the name of a project like `recommendations`. Defaults to null.
- `articleId`: specifies the `--article-id` to filter some tests. Defaults to null.
- `revision`: the branch of elife-spectrum to use, for example `origin/new_feature`. Defaults to `master`.
